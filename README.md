# 💻 Operating System Lab — Semester 3 (21CSC202J)

### 👨‍💻 Author: **Aayush Raj**
### 🏫 College: SRM Institute of Science and Technology
### 🧩 Language: **C and Shell**

This repository contains all **Operating System Lab Experiments** performed in **Semester 3**, covering both **theoretical** and **practical** aspects of Operating Systems.

Each experiment folder includes:
- 📘 Concept Notes  
- 💻 Source Code (C / Shell)  
- 🧾 Sample Output  
- 📸 Screenshots / Illustrations (if applicable)

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Understand **system calls**, **process management**, and **scheduling**.  
- Learn **synchronization mechanisms**, **deadlock handling**, and **memory management**.  
- Gain hands-on experience in **Linux**, **shell scripting**, and **system-level programming**.
