# 🐚 Experiment 3 — Shell Programs

### 👨‍💻 Author : Aayush Raj  
### 📚 Course : 21CSC202J — Operating Systems Lab  
### 🧠 Objective :  
To learn the structure and syntax of **Bash shell scripts** in Linux and execute basic automation programs using control structures, loops, and command-line arguments.

---

## 🧩 Overview
Shell scripting allows automation of repetitive tasks and execution of Linux commands as programs.  
This experiment demonstrates:
- Variable handling and quoting
- Conditional (`if`, `case`)
- Loop (`for`, `while`)
- File and pattern operations

| `Q3_File_Permission_Check.sh` | Checks and adds execute permission to a file |
| `Q4_List_Subdirectories.sh` | Lists only the sub-directories in current folder |
| `Q5_Search_Pattern.sh` | Searches pattern in files using command-line argument |
| `Notes.md` | Theory and syntax reference |

## ⚙️ Execution
```bash
chmod +x program.sh
./program.sh
```
